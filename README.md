# Ray Tracer

This is a tiny ray tracer, rendering scene purely using CPU.

It uses the `SDL` to present the image to users. (See http://www.libsdl.org/)

# Compile

## Under Windows

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 & 2012 are currently supported. To compile, please open the respective project file in the root folder. We already provide `SDL.dll` in the root folder and the SDL library in the folder `SDL-1.2.15`.

## Under Linux

To compile, please type `make` in the folder `/ray_tracer`, then the file `rt` will be generated in this folder. You should have the SDL library installed first.
