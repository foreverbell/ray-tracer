# Ray Tracer

SDL-based implementation of a tiny and cross-platform ray tracer.

# Compiling

Firstly, you should retrieve the resources from another repository https://github.com/foreverbell/miscellaneous, just executing the `initialize.py` in the root folder.

## Under Windows

Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 is currently supported. To compile, please open the respective project file in the root folder. We already provide `SDL.dll` in the root folder and the SDL library in the folder `lib/SDL-1.2.15`.

**N.B.** Switch to the `Release` mode to improve the efficiency of the program.

## Under Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
cd src/
make
./rt <demo_id>
```

# Demos

We currently provide 6 demos for testing.

The first demo presents two Utah teapots ported from GLUT, with the `material_transparent` to show the reflection & refraction.

The second demo presents the Earth with texture. This is a real-time demo, you can press left & right to rotate the camera.

The third demo presents a quadratic surface.

The fourth demo presents the famous Stanford Bunny (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny) stored with the noff file format in `resource/bunny.noff`.

The fifth demo presents a mobius strip.

The sixth demo presents a random fractal terrain generated by `Diamond-Square Algorithm`.

And the followings are several images rendered by our program.
